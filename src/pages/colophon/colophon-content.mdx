I'm designing and growing this website myself, drawing inspiration from <TooltipLink href="https://maggieappleton.com/">Maggie Appleton's Digital Garden</TooltipLink> for it's structure, design and components. The source code is open source and available on <TooltipLink href="https://github.com/timkoval/neuroland">Github</TooltipLink> for you to explore. My blogging journey spans over a decade, during which I’ve experimented with more than five technologies, from WordPress in the mid-2010s to Gatsby, Jekyll, Quartz, and Sphinx. After trying various options, I’ve found Astro to be the ideal fit, blending Markdown simplicity with MDX’s customizable components to suit my needs.

### Technologies & Techniques

 <TooltipLink href="https://astro.build/">Astro</TooltipLink> powers this site, enabling me to create everything from concise notes in Markdown to intricate, content-rich pages that push beyond standard Markdown limits. I value its content collection management, interface optimizations, and visual effects, along with its <TooltipLink href="https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/">islands architecture</TooltipLink> for modular JavaScript.

 I keep the interface lightweight using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while <TooltipLink href="https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx">MDX</TooltipLink> allows seamless text writing with interactive custom components. For animations, I primarily use CSS, following Maggie Appleton’s approach, with more complex effects crafted in <TooltipLink href="https://motion.dev/">Motion</TooltipLink>. 

 I host this site on a VPS via <TooltipLink href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/">Hetzner Cloud</TooltipLink>, appreciating its flexibility and cost-effectiveness for a fully customizable virtual machine.

### Writing and Editing Content

My CMS consists of flat files and folders, where I edit content directly in MDX files using Neovim. I use <TooltipLink href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</TooltipLink>  for daily notetaking, nurturing my notes, ideas, and connections before they evolve into public content. Before publishing, I refine these in a code-like process, adding visual components, effects, animations, and non-Markdown elements to create engaging articles or detailed web pages, especially for [Innovations and Discoveries](/projects) and [Exploration Notes](/notes).

### Typography

Headers are set in <TooltipLink href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4">Source Serif 4</TooltipLink>, and body text uses <TooltipLink href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noto+Sans">Noto Sans</TooltipLink>, both open-source fonts that perfectly complement the academic and tech focus of my site. 

I implement a <TooltipLink href="https://utopia.fyi/blog/designing-with-fluid-type-scales">fluid type scale</TooltipLink> from <TooltipLink href="https://utopia.fyi/">Utopia</TooltipLink>, leveraging advanced CSS calculations to adjust font sizes dynamically based on browser width.

### Growth Stages

Each post here features a **growth stage**, reflecting its development level—starting as <Icon name="seedling" size="20px" /> seedlings, progressing to <Icon name="budding" size="20px" />  buddings, and maturing into <Icon name="evergreen" size="20px" /> evergreens. You’ll find many notes and articles in progress, as I aim to complete them over time, though some remain half-baked until I revisit and deepen them.

### Custom Components

I build on Maggie Appleton’s custom components as a foundation, adapting and creating my own to enhance my content with unique interactivity and design.
